# Kudelski Audit Notes -- application

This document is intended to serve as a communication tool between Interlock and Kudelski for the ongoing smartcontract audit and review.

Please feel free to post questions or comments as you audit, make note in telegram, and I will do my best to answer/address as they come up.

To kick things off, at the end of this document are a handful of preliminary thoughts and notes that I hope will help you moving forward with this audit.

# Preliminary Thoughts and Notes

- This is the smallest and simplest contract in form at least.
- However, this contract may receive the most scrutiny due to its 'generalness' and openendedness.
- I tried to provide as detailed yet concise description as possible to get the points across. Hopefully the diagram helps.
- In terms of the overall scope of audit however, this contract will not be deployed as is, or any time soon, except for the implementation as the UANFT PSP34 contract.
