# Interlock Blockchain: SOPs and MOPs Guide

The intricate nature of blockchain technology and smart contracts necessitates rigorous oversight and accuracy. At Interlock Network, we are committed to maintaining a robust framework of standards and procedures to ensure the secure and efficient management of blockchain-related operations that impact our stakeholders.

## Directory Purpose:

Although Interlock Network doesn't maintain a global procedure management policy, we strictly adhere to one when it comes to blockchain interactions. Drawing insights from leading enterprises that champion quality assurance, we've implemented a system of **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** and **Method of Procedures (MOPs)** to minimize potential risks.

### **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)**:
- **Definition**: SOPs outline the methodology for achieving a specific goal or objective.
- **Example**: For a holistic understanding on how to launch a token, refer to [SOP 1, Launching ILOCK](./bcsop1.ILOCKlaunch.md).
- **Structure**: SOPs often incorporate MOPs to provide clarity on the finer details of the objective. SOPs typically focus on the _why_ and _how_.

### **MOP (Method of Procedure)**:
- **Definition**: MOPs detail the step-by-step process to accomplish a particular task within an SOP.
- **Example**: For instructions on deploying the ILOCK solidity contract for EVM chain integration, see [MOP 1, ILOCK Solidity Deployment](./bsmop1.ILOCKsolidityDeployment.md).
- **Structure**: MOPs typically focus on the _how_ and _what_.

## Procedure Implementation:

Each procedure type comes with a designated template: [bcsop0.standardOperatingProcedureTemplate.md](bcsop0.standardOperatingProcedureTemplate.md) for SOPs and [bcmop0.methodOfProcedureTemplate.md](bcmop0.methodOfProcedureTemplate.md) for MOPs. 

- **To Implement New Procedures**: Use the provided templates that explain each component's purpose. In the future we will implement a review and approval process.

## Importance:

Consistency and transparency are vital to safeguard the high stakes involved in our blockchain operations. We aim for our procedures to mirror the transparency inherent to smart contracts, ensuring that, during emergencies, stakeholders can verify the executed procedures. This for now will be in the form of recording activities and transactions, then publishing these for inspection by community and investors.

## Future Prospects:

We anticipate further refining these procedures. Some MOPs/SOPs might be applied only once. Eventually, we plan to encode procedural information within smart contracts governed by a dedicated DAO.

## Feedback:

Stakeholders are urged to review our procedures. Any suggestions, corrections, or insights can be emailed to `smartcontracts@interlock.network` or raised as a discussion on our Github repository page.

Thank you for your attention and engagement,
