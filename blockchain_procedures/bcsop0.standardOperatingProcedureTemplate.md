### Purpose and Scope:

#### What

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) offers a set of guidelines and routine practices that are followed for the operations of the Interlock Network. While a MOP is step-by-step, an SOP provides a broader perspective on how operations should generally be approached.

#### Why

Given the complexities of managing and operating in the web3 and blockchain environment, an SOP ensures that there is a standard and consistent approach in handling regular operations. This consistency is meant to prevent mismanagement, inefficiencies, and promotes best practices within the organization.

#### Additional Information

SOPs are essential in ensuring that processes remain consistent even as team members change. They serve as a foundation for training and provide clarity on expected outcomes of regular procedures.

### Procedure and Roles:

The SOP is designed to guide individuals holding various roles within the Interlock Network. This includes developers, network operators, administrators, and executive leadership. It is essential for all involved to be familiar with the SOP to ensure the seamless operation of the Interlock Network blockchain activities.

### Reference MOPs:

SOPs often refer to MOPs for specific step-by-step instructions. It's crucial to ensure that all relevant MOPs are listed and kept up-to-date to provide a clear picture of how specific tasks should be executed in alignment with the broader operating guidelines.

### Resources and Communication:

Ensure that all relevant tools, software, and communication channels are listed and accessible. For the Interlock Network, this might include development tools, testing environments, communication platforms, and emergency contact details.

### Review and Update:

SOPs, like MOPs, are living documents. As the network grows, evolves, and adapts to new challenges, the SOP should be reviewed periodically. Updates should be made to reflect new practices, tools, or changes in operational approach.

### References

Relevant research papers, best-practice documents, or resources that influenced or support the SOP should be listed here.
