### Purpose and Scope:

#### What

This MOP is to prepare those filling the roles involved in the ILOCK deployment and TGE.

#### Why

There is a bunch of stuff that has to be prepared before we can claim ready to launch the ILOCK token.

#### Additional Information

N/A

### Roles and Expected Outcomes:

ILOCK token launch leadership is responsible for ensuring the successful completion of this preparatory MOP.

### Resources and Safety:

The only safety issue to consider here is the fact that if insecure, data in the preparatory phase my be vulnerable to snooping and modification. All roles involved in this MOP should ensure that their personal passwords and access secrets are safe.

### Detailed Instructions:

Do the following:

#### [] 1. create ownership accounts on target blockchains (Arbitrum, eg)

Do this via your wallet of choice. This account will launch the contract, and serve into the future as the contract admin. Naturally, save the private key/mnemonic phrase in a secure place. (Note, that it appears Subwallet supports both Aleph Zero and Arbitrum, though am unsure about Metamask.)

For ILOCK initial launch & TGE you will need two accounts for ownership:

##### [] Arbitrum Mainnet
##### [] Aleph Zero Mainnet

#### [] 2. charge these account with native coin

By current projections, we will need around 3000 USD$ worth of $ETH for gas fees to setup contract on Arbitrum, and about 1000 USD$ worth of $AZERO to setup contract on Aleph Zero. Work with blockchain engineer to acquire final gas estimation according to final list of stakeholders and airdrop recipients:

##### [] charge Aleph Zero address with     XXXX $AZERO
##### [] charge Arbitrum address with       XXXX $ETH   

#### 3. identify (minimum of) two other owner accounts for multisig setup in later MOP

They do not need to provide their private keys. They will sign multisig on their own via Safe, but we do need their account addresses, and they do need to be available to sign.

#### 4. settle on a drop dead date and announce

When does the launch/TGE happen. For real and announce that shit to make it happen.

#### 5. collect all final data for investors and from sale platforms and airdrop campaigns

#### 6. settle on launch method

This may be executive running launch in isolation, but this would be done most simply by blockchain engineer Team Viewing into exec's computer and launching remotely under exec supervision.
