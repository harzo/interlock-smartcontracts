If you are here looking for instruction or guidance, skim this then try to find the SOP or MOP that suits your need and go there now.

# Interlock Blockchain SOPs and MOPs - Overview:

Naturally, smart contracts and anything relating to a blockchain necessarily demand a higher level of care, scrutiny, precision, reliability, etc, than ancillary realms of web3 tech.

For this reason, we at Interlock Network hold ourselves to a high professional and technical standard when it comes to managing those technical, administrative, and clerical blockchain affairs that (may) immutably affect our stakeholders' web3 well being. For the purpose of these documents, a 'stakeholder' is an interlocker -- that is, anybody with an interest in seeing Interlock Network and the Interlock community at large stay safe and secure. We are as it is, in the business of providing safety and security as a product.

## Purpose of this directory:

Interlock Network has no official procedure management policy as an organization, but in the realm of smart contracts and blockchain interaction we do. Drawing from the wisdom of multibillion dollar technical and business enterprises (who generally adhere to six sigma standards in quality assurance, contractually) we implement a system of _Standard Operating Procedures_ and _Method of Procedures_ to ensure that our risk of technical or general procedural malfunction is minimized. In the world of product/project/organization management, these are boilerplate concepts and implementations. Here is how we choose to implement them:

### What is an _SOP_?

An SOP is a Standard Operating Procedure, and this answers the question of **how** we do something to achieve a goal, objective, or target. _How_ generally specifies the _whats_ to do in context. So, for example, how do we launch a token in its entirety? An SOP would be dedicated to answering that _how_. (For example, [SOP 1, Launching ILOCK](./bcsop1.ILOCKlaunch.md).)

SOPs generally specify _how_ by specifying the _what_ as various _MOPs_ in context of the objective.

### What is a _MOP_?

A MOP is a Method of Procedure, and this answers the question of **what** we do to achieve some fine-grained objective or outcome. _What_ specifies the specific steps required to do the thing outlied as a part of some greater _SOP_ (generally). A MOP is an instruction manual, whereas a SOP is a formal guidline. For example, how do I deploy the ILOCK solidity contract that we employ for purposes of integration with EVM chains? A MOP would be dedicated to answering that _what_. (For example, [MOP 1, ILOCK Solidity Deployment](./bsmop1.ILOCKsolidityDeployment.md).)

# Procedures: Standards and Methods:

Each procedure type -- standards and methods -- has a corresponding template. These are, `bcsop0.template.md` and `bcmop0.template.md`.

Use these templates to implement new SOPs or MOPs. The templates will contain the basic components of each procedure type, as well as explainations for what each component does.

If you create a SOP, you will need to acquire an approval from somebody that manages the smart contract repo, as well as somebody that doesn't, as an 'extra pair of eyes'.

If you create a MOP, you just need a repo manager's approval.

These approvals are listed in the SOP/MOP.

## Why?

To sustain reliability and avoid accidental catastrophe, etc, we need to adhere to consistent standards. The stakes are too high for blockchain affairs at Interlock Network to leave our contract and blockchain activities vulnerable to internal whimsy and inconsistency. The purpose of this strategy is to make our SOPs and MOPs transparent in the same way that smart contracts are, so that in the event of an emergency, you know whether or not the procedure was adhered to. (As in, in most cases, the operations contained within this directory are verifiable.)

# Now what?

This will be a continually iterative process to refine these SOPs and MOPs. Many of them will only be used once.

Eventually, the information within this directory will be encoded into smart contracts and managed by a proper DAO. That is some time off though.

## Conclusion:

We as an organization encourage you, the interlocker, to review these procedures and proffer feedback at `smartcontracts@interlock.network` if you find anything that needs mention. Or, you can start a discussion on Github on our repository page.

Thank you for taking the time to read,
